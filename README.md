## Simple Shell

### Description

This shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics the functionality of the Bourne-Again Shell (BASH). It performs most of the basic functions with quite a few additional functionlaties of BASH. This program was written entirely in C as part of the second milestone project in the first sprint of the ALX Software Engineering program.
